* fork -- by arton *

* move variables declaration to the top of the functions for VC++
* put preconfigured Makefile for nmake. (enable iconv and ssl)

* 0.4.5 *

* Includes precompiled Windows binaries for FreeTDS 0.91rc2 & LibIconv. No precompiled OpenSSL yet for Windows to SQL Azure.

* Fixed symbolized unicode column names.

* Use same bigint ruby functions to return identity. Hopefully fixes #19.

* Release static libs for Windows.

* Change how :host/:port are implemented. Now sending "host:port" to :dataserver.


* 0.4.4 *

* New :host/:port connection options. Removes need for freetds.conf file.


* 0.4.3 *

* New Client#active? method to check for good connection. Always use this abstract method.

* Better SYBEWRIT "Write to SQL Server failed." error handling. New Client#dead? check.

* Azure tested using latest FreeTDS with submitted patch. https://gist.github.com/889190


* 0.4.2 *

* Iconv is a dep only when compiling locally. However, left in the ability to configure it for native gem installation but you must use --enable-iconv before using --with-iconv-dir=/some/dir

* Really fix what 0.4.1 was supposed to do, force SYBDBLIB compile.


* 0.4.1 *

* Undefine MSDBLIB in case others have explicitly compiled FreeTDS with "MS db-lib source compatibility: yes".


* 0.4.0 *

* Allow SYBEICONVI errors to pass thru so that bad data is converted to ? marks.

* Build native deps using MiniPortile [Luis Lavena]

* Allow Result#fields to be called before iterating over the results.

* Two new client helper methods, #sqlsent? and #canceled?. Possible to use these to determine current 
  state of the client and the need to use Result#cancel to stop processing active results. It is also 
  safe to call Result#cancel over and over again.

* Look for the syb headers only.


* 0.3.2 *

* Small changes while testing JRuby. Using options hash for connect vs many args.


* 0.3.1 *

* Fix bad gem build.


* 0.3.0 *

* Access stored procedure return codes.

* Make sure dead or not enabled connections are handled.

* Fix bad client after timeout & read from server errors.

*  Do not use development ruby/version, but simple memoize an eval check on init to find out, for 1.8.6 reflection.


* 0.2.2 *

* Fixed failing test in Ruby 1.8.6. DateTime doesn't support fractional seconds greater than 59.
